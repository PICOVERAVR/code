#code
Personal projects from almost non-existant to small.
##Looking for working and/or complete projects?
Check the showcase folder!
###Notes:
- ispc, make fast apps that actually use xmm registers for stuff
	or use GCC autovectorization, there's a guide somewhere on this

##On a new dev box:
	set bashrc location
	
	clone repository
	`clone https://www.github.com/PICOVERAVR/code`
	manually point .gitconfig to inside repo
		`git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig` in main folder
	checkout and track individual branches
		`git checkout --track origin/<branch>`
