## Looking for working and/or complete projects?
Check the showcase folder!
## On a new dev box:
- set bashrc location
- clone repository: `clone https://www.github.com/PICOVERAVR/code`
- manually point .gitconfig to inside repo: `git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig` in main folder
- checkout and track individual branches: `git checkout --track origin/<branch>`
## Things to do:
