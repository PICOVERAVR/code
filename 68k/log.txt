Additional projet ideas:
	make a wall clock using cool 7-seg displays
	air quality measurement using some sort of gas sensor
	add a GSM module or something - usually UART based!
	some sort of laser thing - laser servo application!
	write some sort of graphics application or game
		controlling the screen over UART isn't a good idea, and the maximum data transfer speed over the IO lines is pretty slow
		use my FPGA board to perform DMA on the memory (like the Apple Macintosh)
			DMA would have to work correctly for this to function properly, and 68000 DMA chips are really hard to find
		write an I2C driver that bit-bangs data off the I/O port to something like an SSD1306
			simple, and doesn't require special hardware.
			might be hard to make this fast enough for a fun game
		reviewing OpenGL code before doing this would be helpful for knowing the features I need if 3D graphics are to be included
		screen options are I2C, a simple VGA adapter, or a full on HDMI port
	User board
		could literally just be some switches and (buffered) LEDs
		switches can be pulled high or low, so a read to unimplemented memory can read in values (drive DTACK high until done)
		could also be CPLD-based
			gives me a chance to put something CPLD-based in here
			JTAG experience
			add features like DTACK/BERR generation
			add IO that can actually source current
	Audio board
		could initially just be an op-amp or two connected to a couple lines on the MFP
		probably want a seperate power supply for this to avoid noise on the power lines?
		could also add seperate voices - if I were to do this it would require external hardware, MFP is pretty limited
	Floating point arithmetic
		don't use the 68k floating point hardware - requires a 68020 or greater for coprocessor support
		hardware support without the 68020 is kinda dumb

Rev 1 board:
	Things that were broken:
		Bought a tantulum cap instead of an electrolytic one, didn't notice, and it blew on me
		RX buffering was inverted, luckily caught it before it broke anything
		Only one inverting buffer was used, so all of the TX and RX signals are inverted.
		Some of the silkscreens for the expansion IO were off a little, but I knew about that
		RC values for reset were wrong because I didn't have anything pulling current from it in the simulation
		10uF caps have the wrong footprint
		Mounting holes were too small
		Software Data Protection on the EEPROMs needed to be turned off, but that isn't a huge concern and working around SDP is really annoying with current architecture
		MFP DTACK signal is grounded all the time, but MFP still accepts reads and writes.  Not a huge issue since grounded DTACK makes sense from a logical point of view
		Cold solder joint on 4AN1 prevented the MFP from being triggered

	Things that worked:
		CPU executed code in a loop, RAM word access seemed to be working okay
		MFP can read data values off the bus and manipulate the IO ports just fine.
		MFP can print out characters encoded in instruction literals
		MFP can echo characters off the UART

	Measurements:
		board draws ~270mA when active
		at 14MHz (highest clock freq available that works properly) MFP IO switch time is 10us
		future board clock speed is 12MHz, 16MHz is too fast for the MFP

Rev 2 board:
	Schematic created, but revisions have not been checked at all

Major features to add (in a future redesign):
	Use a later version of the 68000 architecture.
		Having a MMU and a FPU on-chip would be nice
		Should be able to clock it at the same frequencies, which means no high-speed circuit design.
		If I go all the way up to the 68040/68060, I get nice features like JTAG and integrated FPU and MMUs
		Need to worry about heat sink stuff, kinda like a real computer
		At this point it would be easier to design a raspi clone, which is hard to do.
	Replace the hard glue logic with a CPLD
		Should have done this originally, a lot easier to work with and I would have learned way more
		Custom hardware for peripherals, because finding cheap 68000-compatible peripheral chips is annoying
		If glue logic is required, use HCT family instead of LS family. Easier to interface with.
