| EEPROM writing works, since you need to de-assert CS every time you write a byte and you have to wait 200us (way longer than 68k instruction fetches) in order to write a page
| SDP needs to be disabled since the SDP enable sequence is part of the page-write sequence, as well as the fact that the SDP enable sequence would be written to neither chip
| since it has both odd and even addresses.
