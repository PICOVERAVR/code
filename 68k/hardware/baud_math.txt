chip is 5MHz
async to 65kbps
signal to rc/tc controls bit rate

min clock cycle time is 0.95uS
or 450ns high + 450ns low + 50ns extra

goal is 115200, 57600, 38400, 19200, then 9600.

uart - 8 data bits + 1 start bit + 1 stop bit
10 bits/sec
@9600 - bit time is 104 uS

bit rate = 1 / baud rate

1/115200 = 8.680555555 uS per bit - 115,200 kHz clock or 0.11520... MHz
1.8432MHz / 16 = 115200kHz!

clock is ok.

(irrespective of master clock!)
