everything is prefixed with "m68k-elf-"

freerun asm is ori.b #0, D0

bad ideas:
	R/!W going to EEPROM - processor would do weird stuff while EEPROM is writing itself
	letting the MMU handle illegal accesses to low 128K of memory - MMU has to sit between processor and memory
	remove pullup on AS - there to prevent spurious memory acceses once bus master is done and CPU has not relinquished control of the bus yet

ideas for add-on boards:
	UART (in progress)
	Teensy board (audio)
	Graphics (on a screen)
		FPGA used as graphics card
	Expansion card
		DIP holes for prototyping
	RAM expansions
		has to include >= 1MB of ram to be helpful...
	Timer / interrupt controller
		use the 68k chip I already have
	SD support
		should be pretty simple, just a parallel to SPI converter and software for host side

what everything does:
	eeprom-config: python tool for writing and reading data to/from EEPROMs
	split: splits a binary file in two
	upload: application code upload to 68k baseboard + uart board
