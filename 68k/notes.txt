freerun asm is ori.b #0, D0

bad ideas:
	letting the MMU handle illegal accesses to low 128K of memory - MMU has to sit between processor and memory
	remove pullup on AS - there to prevent spurious memory acceses once bus master is done and CPU has not relinquished control of the bus yet
	having the bootloader print stuff without host initiating communication - bootloader will hang waiting on tx buffer to drain if no host is there
	
ideas for add-on boards:
	
	NOTE: all add-on boards have to have space for a board to be stacked on top of them, PC104 style
	MMU board ONLY is allowed to have two ports so more RAM or hardware can be put on top of it and managed.
	
	Debug card
		all the blinkenlights
		7-seg displays?
	UART (in progress)
	Teensy board (audio) or raw audio chip, would be cooler - use C64 SID?
	Graphics (on a screen)
		FPGA used as graphics card
	Expansion card
		DIP holes for prototyping
	RAM expansions
		keep everything DIP, has to be >1MB to be helpful
	Timer / interrupt controller
		use the 68k chip I already have
	SD support
		should be pretty simple, just a parallel to SPI converter and software for host side
		this is just a 'ls595 wired correctly.
			not sure if the chip is fully bidirectional though
	User board
		could literally just be some switches and (buffered) LEDs
		switches can be pulled high or low, so a read to unimplemented memory can read in values (drive DTACK high until done)
	
what everything does:
	eeprom-config: python tool for writing and reading data to/from EEPROMs
	split: splits a binary file in two
	upload: application code upload to 68k baseboard + uart board

MANIFESTO:
	68000 / 68010 compatible board designed for high extensibility without sacrificing too much on features
	ideally clocked faster than a regular 8MHz part, 16MHz should be possible
	I should probably drop the 6850 for something better... check all periph chips for stuff to include
	actual C compiler should be working for this, not BASIC or Forth or anything.  If not C, then only ASM
	higher than 9600 baud rates should be possible
	no legacy interfaces, SD or USB support would be really cool

	new stuff:
		FIFO chips
		dual port RAM chips
		terminal color support!
	
	UART needs to be included.  A bare CPU board is useless. 6800 vs 68k?
		needs to be interrupt driven. figure out 68k interrupt architecture.
