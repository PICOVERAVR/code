start off un-pipelined

modules:
	min CPI and no pipelining
	slow clock is ok
	
	steps:
	------
	
	enable ifetch
	fetch instruction, decode - one step
		wait
	disable ifetch
	if mem ops required, read mem data
		wait
	execute
	if mem ops required, write mem data
		wait
	goto top

	round robin style of execution

pipelined modules:
	ifetch
	idecode
	execute
	mem write
	writeback
	
	all gated
	common rst + enable signal
	
	add memory interface, hazard detection
