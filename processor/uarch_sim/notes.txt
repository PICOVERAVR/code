1. Get software sim working! -- test out instructions we may want?
2. Translate to execution units
	
	write this in SV, read book first!
	
	make sure the memory is external to the processor and writable
	note: I have to have at least two uarch sims to translate into hardware!
	how to execute in parallel:
		have two linked lists of function pointers, traverse through and write
		results to other linked list
		
		only one list is running at a time
		unsure if this works...
		
	still pass the entire processor state between stages
	here we get to deal with hazards!

3. verify output of uarch sim against soft_sim
4. update isa.txt
5. write into hardware
