to do:
	write simulator in C
		have some way of verifying that the output is correct!
		nothing low level, just identify instructions we want/need and encoding
		a great chance to use new features of c that I wouldn't touch!
	? write assembler in yacc/bison (normally would create backend for gcc)
	write low-level simulator in C
		include microarchitecture this time
		start with something that works properly, then play around with optimizations
	write verilog code
		interface to actual FPGA
		learn Xilinx-specific IP and use it (block memory, etc.)
		simulate it
	upload to actual FPGA
		should work after all this testing... hopefully
		write support verilog (UART, memory, etc.)
	
	THEN
		name it
		add doc
		show people
		put in showcase
