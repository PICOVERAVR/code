1. Once we've gotten to this stage, the hardware is mapped out, and the uarch is frozen
	commit the design to verilog - read systemverilog book before starting this, there's
	probably a lot of helpful stuff in there

2. sims to write:
	non-synthesizable
	should be pretty easy to map this to uarch sim
		figure out what needs to be passed from EU to EU
		translate un-optimized version first
	
	synthesizable
		harder to write
		...

3. map common functions to Xilinx IP
	block ram, etc
