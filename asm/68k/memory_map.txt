0x00000 -> 0x1FFFF: EEPROM
	0x0 -> 0x400: EVT
0x20000 -> 0x3FFFF: SRAM
0x40000 -> 0x40001: ACIA Peripheral

code starts at 0x400

still need to do housekeeping such as zeroing out .bss section because
no OS will do it for us

cannot load anything into SRAM at assemble time (yet, bootloader could do that for us)
might need to adjust link script when we start executing code out of RAM?
