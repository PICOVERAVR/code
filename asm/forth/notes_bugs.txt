use clone() to spawn forth interpreters in seperate threads!
( really cheap to create and destroy! )

we should allocate memory dynamically for this to work well

ALLOC and related calls do not allocate more memory if we run out...

profiling does not work for this, as we need the stdlib exit(2) to work to generate a gmon.out

this interpreter needs to be a lot safer.  more sanity checks are in order.

assembler is broken.

NOTE: you really have to review the implementation of this before making any serious changes.  Dumb changes will break things.
